                text="Minecraft skins are made up of two parts: the skin texture and the skin signature. The skin texture is the image that you see in-game, while the skin signature is a unique identifier that allows the game to verify the authenticity of the skin texture. MineSkin generates both the skin texture and the skin signature for you."

                    If you have a Minecraft account you don't regularly use, you can help speed up the skin generation
                    process by providing it to MineSkin.
                    This allows MineSkin to use the account to generate skin signatures more quickly and efficiently.
                    Head over to the <a href="https://account.mineskin.org" target="_blank">Account Manager</a> to
                    provide
                    your account.

                    The MineSkin API allows you to programmatically generate skin data and signatures for use in your
                    own
                    projects.
                    You can find the API documentation and more information on the <a href="https://docs.mineskin.org"
